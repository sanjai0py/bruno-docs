# Run a Collection 

Running your Bruno Collection allows you to interact with, and test, an API. We allow you to run your Collections a few different ways:

### Collection Runner

We have a built-in Collection Runner that allows for **unlimited** runs. 

Run your Collection by either clicking the `...` button next to your Collection in the sidebar then select `Run`

![Click Run](/screenshots/collection-runner/collectionrunroot.webp)

or click the Collection Runner icon in the top bar of the application.

You'll now have access to run the collection, add parameters, or set a delay between requests. 

> *Data-driven testing by using a .CSV file is available in our Golden and Ultimate Edition*

### Automating Runs in CI/CD

Bruno offers a command-line utility to run Collections. This allows you to integrate your tests into a CI and build process.
