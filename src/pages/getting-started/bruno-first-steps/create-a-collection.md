# Creating a Collection 

> *If you have an existing collection inside of another tool that you would like to import, please see Migration & Imports.*
You can create a collection by selecting `Create Collection` from the **home screen** or the **top left corner** of the app.
A popup dialog will appear, asking you to name your collection and choose its location in the file system. You can also choose to edit the generated folder's name.
