# Create a Test 

To ensure your API is behaving as expected, create a test against it. 

Bruno supports writing tests by through either:
- Assertions to declaratively write tests
- JavaScript

To get familiar with testing, open a Collection, select a request, and click on the `Assertions` tab

You can then dictate an expression, operator, and value to test against.
